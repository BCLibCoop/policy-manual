Return of Multi-Part Items to Non-Home Libraries
------------------------------------------------
(((Item Return)))

When items with multiple parts are returned to a non-home library, the non-home library will determine whether or not any parts are missing. The non-home library will attach a note indicating how many parts were missing. Items with multiple parts need to be clearly labeled, or a note added to the item record, so staff know how many parts to look for.
