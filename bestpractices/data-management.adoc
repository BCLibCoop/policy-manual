Data Management

(((Data Management)))

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libraries generate a lot of data.

Co-op Support recommends reviewing what data your library currently collects and considering whether 
you're collecting unnessary data or not collecting needed data; both can be true.

Evergreen can only report on data that is being collected and stored in the database.  It's important
to ensure that data you need is being entered consistently and that your staff know
what data to collect and where in Evergreen to enter it.  For example, if your library provides 
services to multiple constituencies you may need to report on how many patrons are in each.

To protect your patrons you should only be collecting the information necessary to provide your
services to them.

more or less frequently at their library.

[NOTE]
======
If you see staff accounts with the Sitka please leave them be.  These are troubleshooting 
accounts used by Co-op Support.
========

Public Catalogue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At least once a year library staff should check the logo and colours used on their public catalogue
to make sure they are current and match what is used on your website. If your library has additional
links beside your logo they should be checked as well to ensure they are still current. 

Please contact 
Co-op Support your public catalogue needs to be updated.

Integrated 3rd Party Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you cancel a subscription or retire a piece of hardware, like a self check, that authenticates
through Evergreen please let Co-op Support know as soon as possible.  This enables us to remove 
accounts associated with the service so that your patrons' information is no longer available 
to the vendor.
