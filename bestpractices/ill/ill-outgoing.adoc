Using Patron Accounts for Outgoing ILL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Interlibrary Loan)))

The patron permission profiles for ILL (PL ILL, Post-Sec ILL, etc.) are intended for accounts you 
create for other libraries.  These accounts allow you to check out items going to that library so 
they show as checked out in Evergreen and you can easily follow up with a library about all of the 
items that have been sent to them via interlibrary loan.  

NOTE: If you are an Interlibrary Connect library do not set up accounts for the other libraries in your
Connect zone. 

Setting up ILL Patron Accounts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The steps to create an ILL patron account are the same 
as a http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_register_new_patrons.html[regular patron account].  For *Main (Profile)
Permission Group* select the ILL option for your library type.

Recommendation for setting up ILL patron accounts:

* include the library's ILL or general email so that Evergreen sends the library pre-due and overdue email
notifications. 
* include the library's ILL or general address if your library does paper overdues with 
http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_final_notices.html[final notices].  Billing 
notices will be generated for lost materials.
* use a naming convention so you can easily retrieve the accounts via the barcode or patron search.
* request an ILL permission group specific 
http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_circulation_policies.html[circulation policy] so that items have a longer 
loan duration and aren't assessed fines when checked to an ILL account.
* set up ILL specific http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_group_penalty_thresholds.html[group penalty threshold] 
to allow more checkouts to an ILL account than to a normal patron account.


Checking Out Outgoing ILLs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The workflow for sending out interlibrary loans with ILL patron accounts is:

. follow the normal procedures through your 3rd party ILL system to identify the items that need 
to be pulled to be sent to other libraries.
. pull the items from the shelf.
. retrieve the patron account for borrowing library.
. check the applicable items out.
.. the system will follow your default circulation policies unless you have policies specific to the ILL permission
profile.  
. follow the normal procedures through your 3rd party ILL system to send the item to the 
borrowing library.
. when the item is sent back follow your normal procedures through your 3rd party ILL system
 to receive the item.
. the item will either have the status of checked out or in-transit in Evergreen.  Check the item in.
