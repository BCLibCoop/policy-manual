Using Pre-cats for Incoming ILL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(((Interlibrary Loan)))
(((Pre-Cats)))

Pre-cats, also known as pre-catalogued items, are temporary records created at the time of check out.

Pre-cats can be used for incoming interlibrary loans that are not between two Interlibrary Connect libraries.

See Sitka's Evergreen Documentation for information on
http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_circulation_2.html#_pre_catalogued_items[checking out pre-cats].

Some important things to remember about pre-cats are:

* Do *NOT* use the barcode on the item. This causes problems if the item belongs to another Sitka library.

* Pre-cats are temporary and not visible in the OPAC

* A pre-cat only really exists as long as it is checked out

* Make sure you chose the correct circulation modifier at check out to ensure that the item follows the
correct circulation policy.

When using pre-cats we recommend that you have a set of barcodes that you recycle to avoid creating
hundreds of pre-cats in the system. These pre-cat barcodes may take the form of barcoded cards that
are scanned and attached to the interlibrary loan while it circulates.
