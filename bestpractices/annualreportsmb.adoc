Service Area Statistics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

_Service Area - Active Patron Count for Specified Profile by Patron Home Library and Profile_

Use this template to get a count of your total active patrons.

_Service Area - Active Non Resident Patron Count by Patron Home Library, Profile and Stat Cat_

Use this template to get a count of your active non resident patrons broken down by municipality.

This template will only work if you currently record municipality as a statistical category.  Co-op Support 
is working with Manitoba PLSB to have this data collected consistently for future years.


Collections and Circulation Statistics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The statistics you are able to collect will depend the data you have in Evergreen.  For example,
for Media/Format - Video you may have shelving locations specific to DVDs or you may use circulation
modifiers for dvd.

_Collection - Title and Item Count by Shelving Location and Circulation Modifier_

Use this template to gather the statistics for # of Items for Readership Level, Media/Format, 
Languages.

For Media/Format - Digital - # of Items contact your e-resource vendors.

Co-op Support recommends making a note of which shelving locations and circulation modifiers you count
for the different categories so that you use the same ones when reporting your circulation statistics.


_Circulation - Annual Circulation Count by Patron Type and Circulation Modifier_

_Circulation - Annual Circulation Count by Patron Type and Shelving Location_

: Circ stats within Time Span_

Languages.
