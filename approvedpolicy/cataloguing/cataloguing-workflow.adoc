The Cataloguing Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cataloguers should ensure that the Sitka catalogue is always searched as part of their cataloguing process so that
new holdings can be added to existing matching records whenever possible.

This can be done in three way:

* http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_searching_the_database_for_cataloguing_purposes.html[search the Sitka catalogue]
 directly
* include _Local Catalog_ as a source when 
http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_adding_bibliographic_records.html#_searching_via_z39_50[searching via Z39.50]
* select _SitkaMatch_ as your Record Match Set when importing a file of records through the 
http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_batch_importing_bibliographic_records.html[MARC Batch Import/Export] or
the http://docs.libraries.coop/acquisitions/_load_marc_order_records.html[acquisitions module]

The below diagram shows the basic workflow when cataloguing items for which you do not have 
a file of records.

////

Staff must always check the Sitka database first before searching Z39.50 targets, or, in some libraries, a vendor file of MARC records, for bibliographic records.

In order to ensure the integrity of this shared database, the procedures outlined in this section must be followed by all staff and volunteers who perform cataloguing tasks in Evergreen. The Chief Librarian at each member library is responsible for ensuring that staff and volunteers follow these procedures as they apply to their designated skill Level.

Is it a Match?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When adding holdings to an existing bibliographic record in the Sitka catalogue
 it is very important to ensure the physical or electronic item matches what is 
 being described in the bibliographic record.

Cataloguers should use their knowledge of RDA and MARC coding to determine which record
matches the item they are cataloguing.

Remember, a record is NOT a match if:

* it has a different identifier (ISBN, ISSN, UPC)
* it has a different publisher and/or publication date
* it is a different format (book vs. e-book, dvd vs. BluRay)
* it is a different edition (American vs. UK)
* it has a different page count and/or dimensions

A record is also NOT a match if it does not contain enough information to confirm that the 
record and item are a match.  Generally missing a combination of identifier (ISBN, ISSN, UPC), 
author, publisher, and publication date, will make it impossible to confirm that the item 
and record match.  In this case cataloguers should add or create a new bibliographic record. 

Brief on order records may not contain all key information but still contain enough that a
cataloguer can be confident that the record matches their newly published item. In this case
cataloguers should add their holding to the existing brief on order record.
