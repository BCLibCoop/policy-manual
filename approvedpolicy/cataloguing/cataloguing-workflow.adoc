The Cataloguing Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cataloguers should ensure that the Sitka catalogue is always searched as part of their cataloguing process so that
new holdings can be added to existing matching records whenever possible.

This can be done in three way:

* http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_searching_the_database_for_cataloguing_purposes.html[search the Sitka catalogue]
 directly
* include Local Catalogue as a source when 
http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_adding_bibliographic_records.html#_searching_via_z39_50[searching via Z39.50]
* selecting SitkaMatch as your record Match Set when importing a file of records through the 
http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_batch_importing_bibliographic_records.html[Batch Import/Export] or
the http://docs.libraries.coop/acquisitions/_load_marc_order_records.html[acquisitions module]

The below diagram shows the basic workflow when cataloguing items for which you do not have a file of records.

////

Staff must always check the Sitka database first before searching Z39.50 targets, or, in some libraries, a vendor file of MARC records, for bibliographic records.

In order to ensure the integrity of this shared database, the procedures outlined in this section must be followed by all staff and volunteers who perform cataloguing tasks in Evergreen. The Chief Librarian at each member library is responsible for ensuring that staff and volunteers follow these procedures as they apply to their designated skill Level.
