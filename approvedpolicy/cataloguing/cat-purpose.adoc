Purpose
~~~~~~~

The purpose of Sitka's Cataloguing Policy to is clearly lay out the standards for cataloguing within
the shared Sitka catalogue to ensure that all libraries are treating bibliographic records in the 
same manner when they are editing or creating records.

The goal is to have a database of high-quality bibliographic records that are used by all libraries.  
It is key that all Sitka libraries follow the same policies when editing MARC records to ensure that
records accurately reflect the items that are attached to them.

The bibliographic records in the Sitka database are the shared property of the BC Libraries 
Cooperative, regardless of the holdings attached. It does not matter which library “created” the record, 
who transferred it into the database, or who has edited it since. 

Maintaining the quality and integrity of each bibliographic record is an interest and a responsibility 
we all share.

Sitka's cataloguing policy was originally developed by the BC Libraries Cooperative in 2009 with 
recommendations from the then Sitka Cataloguing Working Group.  The policies are updated by Co-op
Support as needed to reflect changes in cataloguing standards and changes to Sitka recommendations.

////
With recommendations from the then Sitka Cataloguing Working Group, the BC Libraries Cooperative set 
standards for cataloguing workflows and MARC records and developed the first version of this policy 
in 2009. This Cataloguing Policy is referenced in the training provided by Co-op Support, and 
is supplemented by Sitka's Evergreen Documentation located at http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/. 
Sitka member libraries are expected to familiarize themselves with this policy, and endeavour to 
uphold it in their local cataloguing workflows.

Sitka consortium libraries are committed to creating a database of high-quality bibliographic records 
for collective use. These bibliographic records are the shared property of the British Columbia Libraries 
Cooperative, regardless of the holdings attached. It does not matter which library “created” the record, 
who transferred it into the database, or who has edited it since. Maintaining the quality and integrity 
of each bibliographic record is an interest and a responsibility we all share.
