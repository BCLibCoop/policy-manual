Cataloguing Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bibliographic Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Libraries are expected to follow cataloguing standards when creating new bibliographic records or editing 
existing bibliographic records in Sitka's Evergreen.

Bibliographic records should follow both https://www.rdatoolkit.org/[RDA standards] and 
https://www.loc.gov/marc/[MARC standards].

Non-Bibliographic Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Libraries may create records for non-bibliographic items, such as a library of things.  It is recommended
that libraries generally follow cataloguing standards when creating these records (i.e. enter a name for 
the item in the 245 title field) but these records do not need to meet the same standards as bibliographic
records.

Libraries should create their own non-bibliographic records rather than attaching to existing ones from
other libraries unless working with a shared collection.

Subject Headings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When assigning subject headings libraries should use terms from an official thesaurus.  Commonly used 
official thesauri include Library of Congress Subject Headings, LC Subject headings for children's literature, 
Medical Subject Headings, Canadian Subject Headings, and Répertoire de vedettes-matière.

Subject headings not included in official thesauri are considered local subject headings and must be entered 
as such in Sitka's Evergreen.

Classification Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While bibliographic records are shared within the Sitka database call number and item records are not.  
Libraries are free to use whatever classification system(s) meets their needs for their call numbers. 

Libraries should enter local call numbers through the holdings editor, and not into the bibliographic record.
