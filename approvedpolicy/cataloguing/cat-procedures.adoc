Cataloguing Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For member libraries, there are many benefits to sharing a database of high-quality bibliographic records for collective use. Staff will learn to think consortially, with the resources of several libraries at their disposal, instead of relying on the local technical services staff alone. Cataloguing workflows will change, with Sitka being the primary source of copy cataloguing for many libraries.

Staff must always check the Sitka database first before searching Z39.50 targets, or, in some libraries, a vendor file of MARC records, for bibliographic records.

In order to ensure the integrity of this shared database, the procedures outlined in this section must be followed by all staff and volunteers who perform cataloguing tasks in Evergreen. The Chief Librarian at each member library is responsible for ensuring that staff and volunteers follow these procedures as they apply to their designated skill Level.

Minimum Requirements For a Match in the Sitka Database or Z39.50 Targets- Updated 2018
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum requirements for determining a match include Title, GMD, the 336, 337 and 338 fields in RDA records, Author, Edition, Imprint (Date, Publisher, Physical Description) and Format. Note that the minimum criteria for an exact match for DVD and software need to be detailed, e.g. Blu-ray vs. regular DVD, aspect ratio (widescreen vs. full screen), PC versus Mac, etc.

CAUTION: Format rules have tightened considerably with the 2018 revised policy.  Paperback and hardcover editions are no longer ever considered a match in Sitka, and Sitka cataloguers are asked to take note of this updated policy. Co-op Support now performs regular de-duplication of the Sitka database, and records with multiple formats and ISBNs cause merge errors, reduced de-duplication, and loss of data integrity.


In order to ensure the integrity of the shared database, please follow these steps carefully:

. Always search the Sitka database first to find a match conforming to the minimum requirements.


. If no match is found after searching the Sitka database, search the approved Z39.50 targets. These same fields also represent the minimum requirement for a match when searching Z39.50 targets.


. If more than one matching record is found, follow the instructions in the section called “Characteristics of a "Best" MARC Record in the Sitka Database” to choose the best record.


. If an item has a different binding than the record in the database, the record is not  considered a match, and holdings must not be attached. Sitka's updated 2018 policy does not consider hardcover and paperback formats to be a match.


. For more detailed information on determining a match, we recommend reviewing http://www.oclc.org/ca/fr/bibformats/en/input/default.shtm#CHDJFJHA[OCLC’s Field by Field Guidelines for New Records.]


"Near" Match When Searching the Sitka Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When searching in Sitka, library staff may find a record that closely matches the item in hand, but which may require varying levels of change/correction, addition or in some cases merging with another record. The following chart should be used in conjunction with the Skills Level chart to determine what actions may be taken with a “near” match.

[options=“header”]
|===
|*Issues with Sitka Record*	      | *Possible Actions*| *Task/Action* |
| Obvious typo - text or coding | Change          | Corrected by staff with appropriate qualifications               |
| Pre-publication record        | Add             | Updated by staff with appropriate qualifications|
| Substandard or brief record   |Change, Add, or Merge| Improved to best record standard by staff with appropriate qualifications |
| Enhance an "exact" match record by adding 520, 650, 655, etc.|
Change, Add, or Overlay | Optional - by staff with appropriate qualifications |

Original Cataloguing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Original cataloguing should constitute a very small percentage of records added to the database. The majority of records (>95%) should be found either within the Sitka database or approved Z39.50 targets, or, in some libraries, a vendor file of MARC records. If a record cannot be found within these sources, an original record may be created.

Sitka cataloguing templates are provided to assist library staff in complying with this standard. These templates are based on the section called “Characteristics of a "Best" MARC Record in the Sitka Database”. Sitka templates are only in RDA as of Evergreen version 3.1 in 2018.

For instructions on original cataloguing and cataloguing templates, please refer to the section on http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_creating_new_bibliographic_records.html[Creating New Bibliographic Records.]

Working with On-order MARC Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use of the Acquisitions Module resulted in an increase in the number of brief on-order records in the Sitka catalogue. The Acquisitions Ad Hoc Committee put forth recommendations on handling these brief on-order records. These recommendations were originally approved by the Business Function Group March 21, 2012, and have since been updated by Co-op Support in 2014 and 2018.

* Acquisitions Selectors to follow guidelines for minimum cataloguing requirements in creating brief on-order records.

* Cataloguers can only use brief on-order records to add holdings to if no other, better, record exists in the Sitka catalogue. An Acquisitions library , or another qualified cataloguer at a Sitka library, will change the on-order record to a full bibliographic record in the end, so cataloguers need to make sure they're attaching their holdings to the correct brief bibliographic record.

* If the only record for a title in the catalogue is an on-order record, cataloguers should use that record to add holdings to only if they are sure that it matches format and isbn or other identifier to the title-in-hand. In this situation, cataloguers can overlay or merge the on-order record with the complete record as long as the format and identifier are a definite match and the new record adheres to Sitka Cataloguing Policy. Cataloguers must also ensure that they carry over any 590 or 690 fields from the on-order record to the complete record. (updated Feb 2014)

* If the only record for a title in the catalogue is an on-order record, and it is unclear which format or isbn or other identifier the on-order record describes, cataloguers should bring in a new record via Z39.50 and attach their holdings to it. (updated Feb 2014)

* Cataloguers can overlay brief on-order records when using the MARC Batch Import/Export function. When importing, cataloguers must always use the Sitka overlay profile to ensure data in the 590 and 690 fields of the original record is preserved. Cataloguers should ensure that the brief records is for the same format as the item they are cataloguing. By default, brief on-order records use the Book 008 field regardless of the true format of the item.

Working with On-order Item Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Libraries that allow patrons to place holds on items that are on order can create placeholder items to display in the catalogue. These placeholder items are created as described in the http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/add_holdings.html[Adding Holdings to Bibliographic Records] section of Sitka's Evergreen Documentation, but with temporary information used to fill some of the item record fields.

Approved practice for cataloguers include the following:

* Use fake barcodes which include your library code, and have somewhere to record where you are in the sequence. i.e. MPL1000, MPL1001, MPL1002

* Use ON ORDER as your call number.

* Use Evergreen's On order status for the item record.

* Have an On Order copy template for cataloguers to use.

* Create and use an ON ORDER copy location, especially if your library uses a new book copy location.

When the items arrive, the cataloguer simply updates the barcode, call number, and copy characteristics, rather than creating a new item and deleting the fake item. This ensures that any holds placed on the copy will be filled.


Working with RDA Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
RDA records and AACR2 records can co-exist in Sitka’s Evergreen, with the preference being for RDA. Both types of records can be imported into the system, and for the foreseeable future, Sitka’s Evergreen will support both standards.

The following are approved guidelines for RDA records in Sitka’s Evergreen:

* Leave an RDA record as RDA; do not modify a RDA record back to AACR2.
* Copy cataloguers should add their copies to RDA records in the same way as they do to AACR2 records.
* We want to minimize duplication of records; use the RDA record if already in Sitka, but do not import an RDA record if an AACR2 record for the same title already exists in Sitka. Instead, attach your copies to the AACR2 record.
* At import, when choosing between 2 MARC records of equal quality, one in RDA and one in AACR2, prefer the RDA record.
* Original cataloguing is done in RDA exclusively, as of Evergreen version 3.1 in 2018. Cataloguing templates are provided in RDA only.
