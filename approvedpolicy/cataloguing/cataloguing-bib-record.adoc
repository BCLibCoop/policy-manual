The Bibliographic Record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RDA records and AACR2 records co-exist in the Sitka catalogue.  New records should always follow the 
RDA standard.

The following are approved guidelines for RDA records in Sitka’s Evergreen:

* Leave an RDA record as RDA; do not modify a RDA record back to AACR2.
* Copy cataloguers should add their copies to RDA records in the same way as they do to AACR2 records.
* We want to minimize duplication of records; use the RDA record if already in Sitka, 
but do not import an RDA record if an AACR2 record for the same title already exists in 
Sitka. Instead, attach your copies to the AACR2 record.
* At import, when choosing between 2 MARC records of equal quality, one in RDA and one 
in AACR2, prefer the RDA record.
* Original cataloguing is done in RDA exclusively, 
as of Evergreen version 3.1 in 2018. Cataloguing templates are provided in RDA only.


Minimum MARC Record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MARC records for bibliographic titles should always meet the minimum requirments and ideally should
exceed them.

The following fields outline the fields that must ALWAYS be present in the MARC record.

|========
|MARC Field | Required Subfields | Material Type | Description
|Leader | N/A | ALL | Contains information required for Evergreen to process the record.
|006 | N/A | Required for podcasts, e-books, e-audiobooks, e-videos, websites, streaming music, and 
streaming videos. | Contains coding used by Evergreen for search filters and format icons.  
|007 | N/A | Required for soundrecordings (spoken and music), computer/video games, playaways, podcasts, 
e-books, e-audiobooks, e-videos, websites, streaming music, and streaming videos. | Contains coding 
used by Evergreen for search filters and format icons. 
|008 | N/A | ALL | Contains coding used by Evergreen for search filters and format icons. 
|020/022/024 | $a | ALL | Contains the standard identifier used internationally. Every bibliographic records should
have at least one 020, 022, or 024 field.
|1XX | $a | ALL, with exceptions where the title is added entry. | Contains the entity responsible for the work (person, corporation, conference, etc.)
|245 | $a, $c | ALL | Contains the title and author.
|264 | $a, $b, $c | ALL |  Contains the place of publication, publisher, and date of publication or copyright.
|300 | $a, $c ($c not required for e-records) | ALL | Contains the physical description of the item 
including number of pages and dimensions.
|========

On order records are an exception as some of the required information may not yet be available.  On order
records should always be updated to at least meet the minumum when the item is received and added to the
collection.

A Good MARC Record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A good MARC record will contain more than just the bare minumum.  This makes it easier for patrons 
to locate the titles they're looking for in your public catalogue as well making it more evident what 
title is being described in the record so cataloguers can confidently attach their own holdings.

The fields included in a MARC record will vary depending on the type of material being described.

The MARC21 Format for Bibliographic Data is available in 
https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/[English] and in 
https://www.marc21.ca/M21/BIB/B001-Sommaire.html[French].  These websites contain information on all 
MARC fields and subfields.

In addition to the mimumum required fields a good MARC record should also contain, where applicable:




Control Fields
++++++++++++++


Standard Numbers
++++++++++++++++

* 010 Library of Congress Control Number (LCCN) is the control number for MARC records distributed by the Library of Congress. Can often be found in the Cataloging in Publication (CIP) information on verso page of a book. Can be useful searching number.

* 020 International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a unique number assigned to items by publisher. Can be 10 or 13 digit number. Sitka support and training team recommend searching Evergreen and Z39 targets, by both numbers, if present on item, before proceeding to original cataloguing. When cataloguing an item, if both numbers are present, enter both in separate 020 tags.

* 022 International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is a unique number assigned to a serial title.

* 024 Universal Product Code (UPC) is a twelve digit number often assigned to sound recordings and videos.

* 028 are Publisher Control Numbers, formatted numbers used for sound recordings, printed music, and videorecordings.

Main Entry
++++++++++

Title
+++++

*Title*: 245 tag contains all the important title information and General Material Designations (GMD). 245 subfields a and b are title and sub-title respectively, 245c contains the statement of responsibility, and 245h is for approved GMDs. Note, for RDA records, the GMD is no longer used; instead the tags of 336, 337 and 338 are used (see below).

Edition
+++++++

*Edition Statement*: 25X tags contain important descriptive information about the item being described. This information includes edition statement, imprint and other publication source information.

Publication Information
+++++++++++++++++++++++

*Publication Information*: 264 tag and subfields a, place of publication, b, name of publisher, and c, year of publication, contain critical publication information and should be as complete as possible. When assessing record, matching the 264/260 tag should always be considered. Note, the second indicator of 264 should be filled: 1 for publication, 2 for distribution, etc.

Physical Description
++++++++++++++++++++

*Physical Description of Item*: 300 tag is used to physically describe an item as completely as possible.

*Content, Media and Carrier type*: 336, 337, 338 tags are used for RDA records only. The fields of content, media and carrier collectively replace the GMD (245$h). For 336, subfield $a is content term and $2 rda content. For subfield 337, $a is media term and $2 is rdamedia. For 338, $a is carrier term and $2 is rdacarrier. See here for appropriate RDA terms.

Series Information
++++++++++++++++++

*Series Information*: 440 and 490 are used to describe relevant series.  440 was officially made obsolete in 2008, but you will still find it used in records that predate 2008, but for correct, current  series cataloguing use the 490 tag.

Notes
+++++

*Notes*: 5xx tags are useful, keyword searchable notes tags, which assist in description and retrieval of items. Use the 500 tag for a note that cannot be placed in any other 5xx tag as per MARC standards.

Subject Headings
++++++++++++++++

*Subjects*: 6xx contain subject headings that follow standards for personal, topical, geographical, and genre terms. Use 690 for local, non-standard subject headings.



Call Numbers
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Classification Numbers*: Evergreen does not display call numbers from the shared MARC record, but the data is useful for searching, matching, and assessing quality of a MARC record. Evergreen uses each library's volume record for local call number display, and will give you the option to auto-fill your number from the MARC record if you want to use that call number as yours.

* 05X are standard classification (call) numbers that are, or can be, present in a MARC record. The most common are the 050, which is the Library of Congress Classification Number (LCC), assigned by the Library of Congress, and the 055, which is the Canadian LCC.

* 082 is the Dewey Decimal Classification number (DDC).

* 090 and 092 are tags reserved for a library's local call number. This data is not used by Evergreen for call number display, but you will often see data there from a different library whose system may use the MARC record for call number display.

Subject Heading Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When adding subject headings to a bibliographic record libraries should use terms from an official 
thesaurus.  Commonly used official thesauri include Library of Congress Subject Headings, LC Subject headings for children's literature, 
Medical Subject Headings, Canadian Subject Headings, and Répertoire de vedettes-matière.

Subject headings not included in official thesauri are considered local subject headings and must be entered 
as such in Sitka's Evergreen.

Sitka Subject Headings
++++++++++++++++++++++

The Sitka team is working with member libraries to identify and remove harmful subject headings from
the Sitka catalogue.  Many of these subject headings are still in the official thesauri.

Where subject headings have been replaced through the work of the Co-op and the Cataloguing Working Group
the MARC field has the second infi 





Series Cataloguing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sitka libraries use the 490 tag for a series title statement, which is the current Library of 
Congress standard. The 490 should include subfield $a and subfield $v.  If an added entry 
is required, you must use the 800 or 830 tag. 

The 440 tag has been obsolete since 2008, 
and while records containing 440 tags are still in the catalogue, new series statements 
must follow the current standard.
