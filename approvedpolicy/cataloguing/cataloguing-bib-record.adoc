The Bibliographic Record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MARC21 Format for Bibliographic Data is available in 
https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/[English] and in 
https://www.marc21.ca/M21/BIB/B001-Sommaire.html[French].  These websites contain the 
authoritative information on all MARC fields and subfields.


Sitka's Minimum MARC Record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MARC records for bibliographic titles in the Sitka database should always meet the minimum 
requirements set in this policy and, ideally, should exceed them.

The following table outlines the fields that must ALWAYS be present in the MARC record.

available. Brief on order records should always be updated to at least meet the minumum 
requirement when the item is received and added to the collection.

A Good MARC Record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A good MARC record will contain more than just the bare minumum.  This makes it easier for patrons 
to locate the titles they're looking for in your public catalogue as well making it more evident 
what title is being described in the record so cataloguers can confidently attach their 
own holdings.

The fields included in a MARC record will vary depending on the type of material 
being described.

In addition to the mimumum required fields a good MARC record should also contain, where 
applicable, the following fields:

|========
|MARC Field | Name | Description

the Library of Congress.

a national bibliographic agency, such as Library and Archives Canada.
|https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd250.html[250] | Edition Statement | Contains information about the version of the material, when 
multiple versions exist.

with sufficient knowledge should add them to records as applicable.

Local Information in Cataloguing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Library Specific Local Information
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
[[_library_specific_local_information]]
(((Local Information)))

Some information included in bibliographic records is specific to a particular library.  In
the shared Sitka database libraries are required to identify this information using a 
scoping subfield as outlined in the table below.

The information will apply to all items attached to the record belonging to 
the scoped library.

.Library Specific Local Information
[options="header"]
|=============
|MARC Field|Field Name|Scoping Subfield|OPAC Visible?|Use
|506|Restrictions on Access Note|5|Yes|Used to note who is allowed to access the resource.
|521|Target Audience Note|5|Yes|Used to indicate the audience the resource is intended for (ie. reading level or video rating).
|540|Terms Governing Use and Reproduction Note|5|Yes|Used to note how the resource can be used (ie. Public Performance Rights).
|59X|Local Notes|5|No|Used for any local notes that do not fit into another field.
|595|Local Notes (Indexed)|5|No|Used for any local notes that need to be searchable in the OPAC.
|69X|Local Subject Access Fields|5|Yes|Used for local subject headings (ie. not Library of Congress or Canadian Subject Headings).
|856|Electronic Location and Access|9|Yes|Used to provide the URL for access to electronic resources.
|=============

Please refer to the Library of Congress' https://www.loc.gov/marc/[MARC Standards] for further
information regarding these fields.

Item Specific Local Information
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
[[_item_specific_local_information]]

Information that is specific to items should NEVER be included in the bibliographic record.
Instead this information should be included in the relevant item attribute so that it is
included in the item record.

The information will apply to the specific item.

.Item Specific Local Information
[options="header"]
|=============
|Name|Patron Visible|Use
|Item Statistical Category|No|Used for commonly repeated information about a specific item (ie. vendor).
|Item Note|No|Used for information specific to the item (ie. Adopt a Book sponsor).
|Item Note (Public)|Yes|Used for information specific to the item that may be of interest to a patron (ie. autographed copy).
|Item Alert|Yes|Used for information that should been seen when an item is checked in or out (ie. Damage or number of pieces to check for). CAUTION: some 3rd party self check machines cannot display item alerts.
