Adding Bibliographic Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Importing via Z39.50
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When adding bibliographic records to the Sitka database via Z39.50 cataloguers should always
prefer records that follow the RDA standard.

When importing new records via Z39.50 cataloguers should edit the record to ensure it accurately
describes the title being catalogued.  Local information from the record source should be 
removed as it does not apply to Sitka's Evergreen. This information is generally found in the
59X and 9XX fields of the MARC record.

Original Cataloguing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When creating new bibliographic records in the Sitka database they should always follow the
RDA standard.

Original cataloguing should constitute a very small percentage of records added to the database. The majority of records (>95%) should be found either within the Sitka database or approved Z39.50 targets, or, in some libraries, a vendor file of MARC records. If a record cannot be found within these sources, an original record may be created.

Sitka cataloguing templates are provided to assist library staff in complying with this standard. These templates are based on the section called “Characteristics of a "Best" MARC Record in the Sitka Database”. Sitka templates are only in RDA as of Evergreen version 3.1 in 2018.

For instructions on original cataloguing and cataloguing templates, please refer to the section on http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_creating_new_bibliographic_records.html[Creating New Bibliographic Records.]

Working with On Order Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Working with On-order MARC Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use of the Acquisitions Module resulted in an increase in the number of brief on-order records in the Sitka catalogue. The Acquisitions Ad Hoc Committee put forth recommendations on handling these brief on-order records. These recommendations were originally approved by the Business Function Group March 21, 2012, and have since been updated by Co-op Support in 2014 and 2018.

* Acquisitions Selectors to follow guidelines for minimum cataloguing requirements in creating brief on-order records.

* Cataloguers can only use brief on-order records to add holdings to if no other, better, record exists in the Sitka catalogue. An Acquisitions library , or another qualified cataloguer at a Sitka library, will change the on-order record to a full bibliographic record in the end, so cataloguers need to make sure they're attaching their holdings to the correct brief bibliographic record.

* If the only record for a title in the catalogue is an on-order record, cataloguers should use that record to add holdings to only if they are sure that it matches format and isbn or other identifier to the title-in-hand. In this situation, cataloguers can overlay or merge the on-order record with the complete record as long as the format and identifier are a definite match and the new record adheres to Sitka Cataloguing Policy. Cataloguers must also ensure that they carry over any 590 or 690 fields from the on-order record to the complete record. (updated Feb 2014)

* If the only record for a title in the catalogue is an on-order record, and it is unclear which format or isbn or other identifier the on-order record describes, cataloguers should bring in a new record via Z39.50 and attach their holdings to it. (updated Feb 2014)

* Cataloguers can overlay brief on-order records when using the MARC Batch Import/Export function. When importing, cataloguers must always use the Sitka overlay profile to ensure data in the 590 and 690 fields of the original record is preserved. Cataloguers should ensure that the brief records is for the same format as the item they are cataloguing. By default, brief on-order records use the Book 008 field regardless of the true format of the item.

Working with On-order Item Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Libraries that allow patrons to place holds on items that are on order can create placeholder items to display in the catalogue. These placeholder items are created as described in the http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/add_holdings.html[Adding Holdings to Bibliographic Records] section of Sitka's Evergreen Documentation, but with temporary information used to fill some of the item record fields.

Approved practice for cataloguers include the following:

* Use fake barcodes which include your library code, and have somewhere to record where you are in the sequence. i.e. MPL1000, MPL1001, MPL1002

* Use ON ORDER as your call number.

* Use Evergreen's On order status for the item record.

* Have an On Order copy template for cataloguers to use.

* Create and use an ON ORDER copy location, especially if your library uses a new book copy location.

When the items arrive, the cataloguer simply updates the barcode, call number, and copy characteristics, rather than creating a new item and deleting the fake item. This ensures that any holds placed on the copy will be filled.
